### Recap: Significance tests

- Formulate Hypotheses. (e.g. There is no difference in means in the population)
- Calculating a test statistic for the observed values under the assumption of H0. (e.g. t-value for difference in means)
- Calculating p-values for the test statistic. â†’ significance?
- Calculate effect size (e.g. Cohen's d)

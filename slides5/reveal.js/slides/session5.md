## Histograms

- Histograms give us a very intuitive overview over the distribution of values.

- In STATA, histograms plot the density (y-axis) of a specific value or range of values (x-axis). This tells us which proportion of all observations lie within this range of values.

----

### Example

using the `histogram` command, we can create a simple histogram. (short: ` hist`)

```stata
histogram age
```
```
    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Dev.       Min        Max
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
       hhinc |      2,608    2732.761    2527.943          0      80400
```

---

### Density vs. Frequency
- by default, STATA plots density histograms, meaning that all columns would add up to a total of 1.0.
- We can also ask STATA to use absolute frequencies (numbers of observations per bin).

----

```stata
hist r_age, frequency
```

![](slides/output_2_16.svg) <!-- .element: width="500" -->

---

### bin-width
Please note, that STATA choses the number of "bins" or columns automatically. The property "width=2.2" in the output above means that each bin represents 2.2 years. `start` tells us the value of the first bin.
If needed, we can change this behavior.

- the option `discrete` tells STATA to create one bin per category (here: year)
- the option `bin()` allows us to specify the number of bins ourselves.
- In the same way, we may change width or start
- with `width()` we may specify the range covered by one bin

----

```stata
hist r_age, discrete
```
----

```stata
hist r_age, bin(10)
hist r_age, width(5)
```

---

### vertical lines
- using xline, we can add vertical lines to our plots.
- for example, we can use `summarize`to plot the mean of our variable.

----

```stata
*** Adding a vertical mean line ***
summarize r_age // get the mean
local r_age_mean = r(mean) // save the mean to a local macro
hist r_age, xline(`r_age_mean') // draw the graph
```

---

## Twoway Plots

- Stata offers the possibility to add multiple plots to one coordinate system.
- After the command `graph twoway` two plots can be specified in parentheses
%codecell
*** plotting a twoway plot (histogram and kernel density) ***
graph twoway (histogram r_age, discrete) (kdensity r_age)

## Exporting Graphs
%
We can export graphs for further usage (saved in the working directory):
%
`graph export "graph_name.png", replace`
%markdown
 ## Box Plots
%
- A box plot is another way to display a distribution.
- the central horizontal line in the center of the box marks the _median_.
  - As mentioned before, the median is a measure of central tendency that is more robust to outliers compared to the mean
- the bottom of the box represents the 25quantile and the top of the box the 75quantile.
    - 50of all cases lie within the range of the box.
    - These middle 50are the _Inter Quartile Range_ (IQR)
- The "whiskers" indicate the minimum or maximum (up to 1.5 * IQR)
- extreme outliers are indicated by dots.

### Example: Box Plot for the Age of Respondents

%codecell
graph box income if income<10000, aspectratio(2) scheme(s2mono)

# Learning Module 5.2 Bivariate Plots

## the `by` and `over` options

- using the `by` option, we can compare histograms or box plots across groups.
%codecell
*** drawing a histogram by sex ***
hist r_age, by(female)


%codecell
*** drawing a box plot over sex ***
graph box r_age, over(female)


%codecell
*** generating a dummy varible for respondents older than 25 ***
capture drop old
gen old=.
replace old=1 if r_age > 25
replace old=0 if r_age <= 25
* creating labels
lab var old "respondents older than 25"
lab def old_lab 1"yes" 0"no"
lab val old old_lab

*** drawing the bar graph over sex and over "old" ***
graph bar (mean) income, over(female) over(old)
